make a maze that triggers this bug \/
make sure sprint() does not try to go through unexplored parts of the maze
allow the mouse to require only a relative position of a goal
allow the mouse to run in an arbitrarily sized maze
Add colors and button waits (of course, hardware interface will come later)
